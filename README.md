# CUBIC SYNTHESIS

A rubik's cube-controlled synthesizer + music performance interface, built with MaxMSP and Arduino.
     
## Concept     

Turns the process of solving a rubik's cube into music, from three perspectives:
1. Physical:   
      - accelerometers attached to fingers control the frequency of a continuous, 'lead' synth sound.
2. Mechanical:   
      - the noises made during scrambling are recorded and played back through granular synthesis at every turn.
4. Conceptual:   
      - each facelet is assigned a note and synthesized voice, so each turn of the cube plays chords moving from discordant (scrambled) to harmonious (solved).
